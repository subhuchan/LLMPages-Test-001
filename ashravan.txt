The stillness of the Imperial Gardens was a stark contrast to the chaos Ashravan had expected. He felt… different. Restored, yes, but more. The weight of his past failures, the burden of his betrayals, seemed lighter, less consuming. Shai's restoration, it seemed, had not only returned his physical form but had also cleansed something deeper within him. He still remembered the betrayal of Dilaf, the agony of his imprisonment, but the burning rage had cooled to a simmering resolve.

He walked the manicured paths, the scent of exotic flowers filling his senses. He saw a young woman sketching a koi pond, her brow furrowed in concentration. He remembered another artist, one he had failed to protect. The guilt twisted momentarily, then subsided. He had been given a second chance. He wouldn't waste it.

He sought out the Emperor's new advisors, men and women he knew were corrupt. He gathered evidence, patiently weaving a web of truth around their lies. He worked in the shadows, a ghost from the past, a living testament to the Emperor's past mistakes. He was no longer a pawn in Dilaf's game. He was playing his own.

One evening, as the crimson sun bled across the horizon, he presented his findings to the Emperor. The advisors sputtered, denied, their carefully constructed facades crumbling. Ashravan watched, his expression unreadable. The Emperor, a shadow of his former self, listened intently. 

Suddenly, Dilaf strode into the hall, flanked by guards. “Traitor!” Dilaf roared, pointing a trembling finger at Ashravan. “He seeks to undermine your rule!” He had been waiting for this. Ashravan smiled, a cold, unsettling smile. "You underestimate me, Dilaf." He pulled out a small knife and cut his own wrist. Blood flowed freely, and he began etching sigils into the floor. "I am already bound to the Emperor, and I have some debts to settle."
